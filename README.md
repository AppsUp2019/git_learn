## .gitignore file
a file which Git has been explicitly told to ignore.  
Ignored files are usually build artifacts and machine generated files that can be derived from your repository source or should otherwise not be committed. Some common examples are:  

dependency caches, such as the contents of /node_modules or /packages  
compiled code, such as .o, .pyc, and .class files  
build output directories, such as /bin, /out, or /target  
files generated at runtime, such as .log, .lock, or .tmp  
hidden system files, such as .DS_Store or Thumbs.db  
personal IDE config files, such as .idea/workspace.xml
